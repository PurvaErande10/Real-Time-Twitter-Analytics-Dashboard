# Real-Time-Twitter-Analytics-Dashboard

This project provides a comprehensive analysis of Twitter metrics, including engagement rates, impressions, and tweet interactions. The dashboard features time-based visualizations that dynamically appear during specified intervals, enabling efficient performance tracking

Tasks

1. Create a visual that shows the average engagement rate and total impressions for tweets posted between '01- 01-2020' and '30-06-2020'. Filter out tweets that received fewer than 100 impressions and like should be 0 and this graph should work only between 3PM IST to 5 PM IST apart from that time we should not show this graph in dashboard itself.

2. Build a chart to identify the top 10 tweets by the sum of retweets and likes. Filter out tweets posted on weekends and show the user profile that posted each tweet and this graph should work only between 3PM IST to 5 PM IST apart from that time we should not show this graph in dashboard itself and the tweet impression should be even number and tweet date should be odd number as well as tweet word count be below 30

3. Develop a visualization that compares the number of replies, retweets, and likes for tweets that have received media engagements greater than the median value. Include a filter for tweets posted in between June and August of 2020 and this graph should work only between 3PM IST to 5 PM IST and 7 AM to 11AM apart from that time we should not show this graph in dashboard itself and tweet date should be odd number and media views should be even number as well as tweet character count should be above 20 and need to remove tweet word which has letter 'S'.
